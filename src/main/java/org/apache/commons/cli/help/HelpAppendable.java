 * Defines a semantic scribe. The semantic scribe appends text to an output based on the semantic meaning of the type of string. For example, a Paragraph versus

 * The representation of the semantics is dependent upon the format being output. For example, the plain text output for a paragraph may print the text followed
 * by two line breaks, while an XHTML output would print the text surrounded by &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;.
